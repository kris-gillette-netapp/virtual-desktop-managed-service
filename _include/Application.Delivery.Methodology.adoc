== Application Delivery Methodology
Users can access any applications that are installed the session host virtual machine (SHVM) where their user session is running.

Users are assigned to a pool of SHVMs ("host pool") based on their membership in a user group.  Every SHVM in that host pool is based on the same VM Image, has the same applications and runs on the same VM resources. Each time a user connects, they are assigned to SHVM in their host pool with the fewest current user sessions.

By adding or removing applications from each SHVM in the host pool the VDMS administrator can control which applications VDMS users can access.

Adding (or removing) applications from each SHVM can be performed directly on each SHVM or to a single VM Image which in turn can be deployed to all SHVMs in the host pool.
