This article covers directly installing applications on the SHVMs.  VM Image management is covered in link:images.updateimage.html[this article].

=== Manual Access
The VDMS management portal provides direct access to each VM via a just-in-time local admin account for all SHVMs and business servers.  This access can be used to manually connect to each VM to manually install applications and make other configuration changes.

This functionality is found in Workspace > Servers > Actions > Connect

If domain admin credentials are required, VDMS privileged access management (PAM) functionality to generate domain admin credentials.  Details can be link:administration.pam.html[found here].

=== VDMS Automation
With the VDMS portal, the "Scripted Events" section includes functionality to remotely execute code.

Within Scripted Events, the Repository tab contains "global" scripts that are published by NetApp.  Custom scripts can be added using the "+ Add Script" button.

Within Scripted Events, the Activities tab contains the trigger that causes a script to execute against a set of VMs. For VDMS, the "Manual" and "Scheduled" event types are best to push a script across the appropriate virtual machines.

NOTE: Activities have many available triggers called "Event Types". For VDMS, the "Application Install" and "Application Uninstall" types do not apply. These are RDS-specific triggers and should not be used for VDMS since VDMS is a WVD-based service, and does to follow the design architecture of RDS.

=== Other Automation Tools
Virtual machines in VDMS can be managed with 3rd party management tools.  Application changes and other VM configuration changes can be applied via any compatible tools.
