== Admin Permissions Overview
VDMS admins have limited access to the VDS administration portal.  Because VDMS is a co-managed solution there are permission sets that are not enabled for VDMS admins.  These actions are reserved for the NetApp support team.  If there are actions needed that can not be performed due to permission limitations, please contact support for assistance.

== Account Type Settings
Within the VDMS admin account, the following settings are default.

When enabled, admin is prompted for credentials when connecting to any VM via the VDS portal.

When disabled, admin is automatically authenticated (with auto-generated local admin account) when connecting to any tenant VM via the VDS portal.  Admins are still prompted for credentials when connecting to any platform server VMs.
