== Privileged Access Management
VDMS admins can be given the "PAM Approver" role which enables the admin to grant PAM requests.

PAM requests will generate a domain level admin account to be used to authenticate on VDMS VMs when the just-in-time local admin credentials are not sufficient.

Any VDMS admin can submit a PAM request but only admins with the PAM Approver role can approve the requests.  A PAM Approver can both request and approve their own request.

=== Submit a PAM Request
.To submit a PAM request
. Navigate to your admin username in the upper right corner and click "Settings"
. Select the "PAM Requests" tab
. Click "+ Add"
.. Select a duration, after which these credentials will expire
.. Choose the deployment
.. Enter an email address that the credentials can be provided.  This can be any email address, allowing 3rd parties (e.g. a vendor) to be granted domain credentials.
.. Enter a phone number that can receive text messages
.. Enter any notes for the logs and for the PAM Approver to review.
. Click "Add Request"

=== Approve a PAM Request
